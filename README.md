#  Java Console Calculator

##  Project Description
This is a simple Java console-based calculator.  
It allows users to perform **basic arithmetic operations** such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  
The program takes user input using the **Scanner class**, processes operations through dedicated methods, and runs in a **loop** so multiple calculations can be done until the user chooses to exit.  
It also handles **divide-by-zero errors** gracefully.
